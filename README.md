*The proliferation of wearable smart devices and advancements in edge computing have transformed fitness activity tracking by enabling real-time monitoring and processing of human movement data. While a large body of research exists on Human Activity Recognition, Gym Activity Recognition (GAR) is a less explored and more complex research problem due to individual variations in exercise execution, exercises targeting the same muscle groups, as well as the vast number of exercises. Deployments using GAR classifiers can provide detailed exercise histories, allowing users to monitor progress towards their fitness goals.*

*Sensor selection and placement are crucial in GAR. This work references the MyoGym dataset, which uses a Myo Armband to capture six-dimensional motion data. By treating these data streams as multivariate time series, we apply Time Series Classification (TSC) methods, including the Rocket family of methods, which make use of random convolutional kernels, and deep learning architectures incorporating Gated Recurrent Units, which excel at modeling long-term dependencies.*

*We hypothesise that combining these distinct approaches into a hybrid model improves classification performance. Our research evaluates this hybrid classifier, focusing on its effectiveness compared to the individual standalone methods and on its ability to extract complementary features from the components.*
